# Monsty Corp Unity
Monsty Corp Unity is a now abandonded version of Monsty Corp. This version of the game was abandonded due to Unity's Runtime Fees in 2023 and being remade in Unreal Engine.

## Things not included in the source code
The entirety of Scene 3. This was excluded due to the size of the file, as GitHub has a limit of about 100MB for each file we've made the decision to exclude that file from this repo. It will however be made available from another source in the future.
Anything we don't own the copyright to. This means that a LARGE chunk of the assets we've used have not been included.
Anything we cannot legally disclose. This includes spoilers for the current Monsty Corp story, any Monsty Corp assets we're using in the UE version, and any other thing we are not allowed to give out.
Anything that could cause harm to Lockyz Media, this includes API keys (we've resolved to just outright removing those files).
